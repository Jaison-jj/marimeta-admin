Many girls choose to come to Camp Marimeta over a tennis camp because of the professional quality instruction they receive. With a lush pine backdrop, our facilities include 4 well-lit tennis courts and a high school regulation lit basketball court. You will find many of our pioneer campers here, after taps playing a set or two."
